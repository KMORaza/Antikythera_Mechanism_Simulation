## Simulation of Antikythera Mechanism using JavaFX application
This application is developed to simulate the functionality and features of the historic Antikythera Mechanism. Built with JavaFX, the simulation replicates the movements, calculations, and functionalities of Antikythera Mechanism, offering a modern interpretation.

### Front view of mechanism
Front view of Antikythera Mechanism demonstrates the revolution of planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) around the Sun. In addition to this, I have included the revolution of moons around their corresponding planets.
Order of revolution of planets:
       SUN > Mercury > Venus > Earth > Mars > Jupiter > Saturn > Uranus > Neptune
Orbital motion of moons around their corresponding planets:
 * Revolution of Moon around Earth
 * Revolution of Phobos & Deimos around Mars
 * Revolution of the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) around Jupiter
 * Revolution of Titan, Enceladus, Rhea, Dione, Iapetus, Janus & Epimetheus around Saturn
 * Revolution of Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon around Uranus
 * Revolution of Triton, Proteus, Nereid around Neptune
 (Mercury and Venus has no moons)

The front view of Antikythera Mechanism also has demonstration of Zodiac system, Gregorian Solar calendar, Lunar phase indication and all of their dials are in form of concentric circles.
